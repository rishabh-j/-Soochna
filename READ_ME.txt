Uploaded in the folder are the source files of 'Soochna'.

Django framework has been used to build our app and thus the models and views have been coded in python. MySQL has been used to maintain the database and HTMl/CSS and JavaScript to handle the frontend.

The design is minimalistic to support lower end devices. The UX has also been kept simplistic keeping in mind our target audience (primary school students, their parents and the school teachers, none of who are tech-savvy).

HOW TO ACCESS:
To access the site, the parents or the students can go to http://shaurya98.pythonanywhere.com. By clicking on the class, they can view all the relevant notices with the newest one on top.
For the school, they can log into http://shaurya98.pythonanywhere.com/admin. They can add new users (teachers) and each teacher can add new post (notice). While adding new notice, teacher chooses Name, Class with Section, Title, Text fields. Every teacher will be instructed to keep the title as <teacherName>_<Title>.

There are provisions to add, edit and delete notices. Users can also be added and removed.
